# scripts

A collection of scripts I've written over the years.

Hope you find them useful.

This repository used to only live in my personal gitea instance at
https://git.marcofontani.it/mfontani/scripts but I've recently started
mirroring it to GitHub, in the hope it can be found by a larger audience.
